// Queries returning aggregate, summary, and computed data are frequently used
// in application development. Sometimes these queries are not fast enough.
// Caching query results using Memcached or Redis is a common approach for
// resolving these performance issues. However, these bring their own
// challenges. Before reaching for an external tool it is worth examining what
// techniques PostgreSQL offers for caching query results.
