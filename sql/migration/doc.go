// TL;DR If your looking for schema migration tool you can use:
//
// mattes/migrate, SQL defined schema migrations, with a well defined and
// documented API, large database support and a useful CLI tool. This tool is
// actively maintained, has a lot of stars and an A+ from goreport.
//
// rubenv/sql-migrate, go struct based or SQL defined schema migrations, with a
// config file, migration history, prod-dev-test environments. The only drawback
// is that it got B from goreport.
// SQL Schema migration tool for Go. Based on gorp and goose.
// Is better because the API for using it within your code (FOSDEM2016).
