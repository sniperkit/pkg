Package money (deprecated) uses a fixed-length guard for precision arithmetic.
Implements Un/Marshaller and Scan() method for database
columns including null, optimized for decimal(12, 4) fields.

=> Still rounding errors. Do not use this package

Rounding is done on float64 to int64 by	the Rnd() function truncating
at values less than (.5 + (1 / Guardf))	or greater than -(.5 + (1 / Guardf))
in the case of negative numbers. The Guard adds four decimal places
of protection to rounding.
Decimal precision can be changed in the Precision() option
function. Precision() hold the places after the decimal place in the active
money struct field m.

New()

Creating a new money struct:

	c := New()

Default values are 10000 for decimals, JSONLocale for Marshal/Unmarshal, Swedish
rounding is disabled and i18n.DefaultCurrency (en-US) for number and currency format.

The following options can be set while calling New():

	c := New(Swedish(Interval005), Guard(100), Precision(100))

Those values are really optional and even the order they appear ;-).
Default settings are:

	Precision 10000 which reflects decimal(12,4) database field
	Guard 	  10000 which reflects decimal(12,4) database field
	Swedish   No rounding

If you need to temporarily set a different option value you can stick to this pattern:
http://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2014/01/self-referential-functions-and-design.html

	prev := m.Option(Swedish(Interval005))
	defer m.Option(prev)
	// do something with the different Swedish rounding
