// bitbucket.org/jatone/genieql
// sql query and code generation program. its purpose is to generate as much of the
// boilerplate code for interacting with database/sql as possible. without putting
// any runtime dependencies into your codebase. it only supports postgresql
// currently. adding additional support is very straight forward, just implement
// the Dialect interface. see the postgresql implementation as the example.

// github.com/go-reform/reform
// A better ORM for Go, based on non-empty interfaces and code generation.

// Best of Both: Integers Internal, UUIDs External.
