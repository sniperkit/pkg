Package mail provides functions and services for sending html or text
emails via encrypted or unencrypted connections.

Features: Attachments, Embedded images, HTML and text templates, Automatic
encoding of special characters, SSL and TLS, Sending multiple emails with
the same SMTP connection.

Daemon Manager

The daemon manager handles for each store view a mail daemon... @todo

Running one daemon

To run one daemon for a specific store view:

	todo

Running multiple daemons

When you have configured different stores with different SMTP server, the daemon
will check to only create one new Dialer to a SMTP server, called DialerPool.

Running 3rd party APIs

Currently supported is only the Mandrill API. Other providers will be added on
request: AmazonSES, Mailgun, MailJet, SendGrid, PostMark, etc.

	d := mail.NewDaemon(
		mail.SetSMTPTimeout(20),
		mail.SetScope(sm.Store())
		mail.SetMandrill(),
	)

The API key must be stored in path: mail.PathSmtpMandrillAPIKey

Offline sending

If SMTP has been disabled via config key mail.PathSmtpDisable all emails will
be send to a custom logger.

@todo Instead of sending the emails to a logger, we can use a web interface like
mailcatcher.me to read the emails.

TODO: Think about using a queue for sending emails either an external one or the following
package github.com/albrow/jobs. Think about an abstracted interface for sending email
Job queque for e.g. sending emails â€¦ but we cannot require it as an dependency only for testing
